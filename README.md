## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a copy of this project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-python-jupyter.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd learning-python-jupyter
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the directory and run them to follow along with the learning process.

## Notebooks

The notebooks are listed in order of complexity from basic to advanced topics:

1. [Basics + Data types](Basics%20+%20Data%20types.ipynb)
2. [Lists](Lists.ipynb)
3. [Random](Random.ipynb)
4. [GENERATORS](GENERATORS.ipynb)
5. [Numpy](Numpy.ipynb)
6. [MatplotLib](MatplotLib.ipynb)
7. [Pandas](Pandas.ipynb)
8. [Seaborn](Seaborn.ipynb)
9. [PyTorch](PyTorch.ipynb)

Feel free to explore these notebooks at your own pace. Each notebook covers different concepts, libraries, and methodologies related to Python programming and data science.
